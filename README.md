# PygameChess

My first pygame project This is a simple 2d game with features such as:

- Checking if a move is legal according to chess rules
- Highlighting possible moves
- Stopwatch
- Flipping the board
- Saving a game in txt file and reopening it later
- Listing a history of moves in chess notation
